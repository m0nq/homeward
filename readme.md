###Unsolved Problems

- Upload Cares ability to put in a link is not working
- When an image is uploaded the form shifts otherwise the form is responsive
- The drop down menus on the form will override the content if a user chooses to edit all other content will be replaced.

####Major Hurdles

We overcame! However we have a group of very strong dominant personalities so the beginning days were pretty rough. Once we decided the order of thing appointing Annabelle as the leader of the group and having each task delegated to each member appropriately we successfully accomplished our goal.

####Shout Outs!

- Alex (for bringing humor to our intensity)
- Derek for Mongoose, OAuth, and Heroku help
- Our team for not killing each other
- All of the puppies!!!
